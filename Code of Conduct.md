# Jayasundara Code of Conduct

All members and visitors to the lab are expected to abide by the following code of conduct.

The Jayasundara lab is committed to providing an environment of safety, respect, support and inclusivity. Anyone is welcome to participate in the science we conduct. 

Harassment of any kind related to race, gender, sexuality, religion, age, ability, socioeconomic status, or background is not tolerated. If anyone engages in harassment, discrimination or disrespect of any kind, the lab will take action against such behavior, including verbal and written warnings and if such behavior continues, removal from the lab. If you are being harassed or are witness to someone else being harassed, please contact Nishad Jayasundara. If Nishad himself is the concern, please contact Remy Babich or Rebecca Van Beneden.

Under University of Maine policy, all employees of the university are mandated reporters. If something has happened to you that you wish to discuss in specific regards to sexual harassment, know that any employee is required to report it (details can be found [here](https://extension.umaine.edu/volunteer/orientation/guide-to-mandatory-university-reporting-of-sexual-misconduct/)). Confidential resources are available on campus through Cutler Health Services and the Counselling Center.
